\chapter*{Abstract}
The aim of this research project is to evaluate a heterogeneous design of a \ac{WSN}. From the adjective \textit{heterogeneous}, we intend to point out that the \acp{SN} participating in the proposed \ac{WSN} are dissimilar in terms of energy availability and computational capabilities.   

\par
The research work is divided in two parts: first part of the research work involves studying and implementing packet routing to the base station (or sink) via \ac{CTP} in TinyOS. The later part focuses on designing and evaluating a heterogeneous \ac{WSN} architecture on top of \ac{CTP}.

\par

Th results of the simulation(Cooja simulator for TinyOS) and test-bed evaluations show the benefits of a heterogeneous design in terms of reduced Energy consumption and lowered data traffic by having the data processed by a neighbouring (one-hop or two-hop) heterogeneous data processing \ac{SN}. 

\par
In conclusion, the research work argues that the energy budget and compute power of a \ac{WSN} can be increased by deploying a bunch of heterogeneous \acp{SN} in vicinity. This can be highly advantageous in situations where: a \ac{SN} in distant location from \ac{BS} has to send packets all the way through the tree of adjacent \acp{SN}. To take maximum benefit of the heterogeneous \ac{SN}, we have also provided measures to determine the optimum location to place a heterogeneous \ac{SN} in the \ac{WSN}.


\par
From technical point of view the research work can also be seen as studying and implementing an important aspect of \ac{WSN}, the hybridization of several technologies: networking, data collection, heterogeneity,  \acp{SN} communication and routing. Moreover, \acp{SN} in a \ac{WSN}, need a cost-effective and fair communication channel access arbitration. Therefore, selection and implementation of efficient Routing protocols, implemented at Network layer, is necessary for efficient routing of traffic after the topological set up has been done. Additionally, coherent layer2 and layer3 protocols are needed to test a working model of heterogeneous \ac{WSN}.
